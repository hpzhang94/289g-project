# ECS289G Project Exploring Different Neural Networks for Text Classification

This repo contains the source code for our text classification project.

## CNN

* `cnn-text-classification-pytorch.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook source code for experiments of CNN models
* An example result can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/williamlwcliu/cnn-text-classification-pytorch). There might be slight difference compared to the term paper since there is randomness involved.

## LSTM

* `BiLSTM_TextClassification`: source code and result of LSTM models experiments

## GNN

## BERT
